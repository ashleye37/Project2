# TheMediator

Welcome to The Mediator App! 

Users will be able to visit The Mediator site and set up an account. After this is completed they will be prompted to go to vote or battle mode. 

In vote mode, the user will be shown two photos. They can then click on the photo that they prefer which will give that photo their vote and display the percentage of votes that each photo has received and then will display the next two photos to vote on. 

In battle mode, users will be allowed to submit two photos of their own that will be added to the database of photos and displayed to other users and voted on. The user will also be able to click of their profile for a recap of the photos they have submitted and the votes that have been made on these photos.
