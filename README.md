	- Users will be able to visit The Mediator site and first be prompted to set up an account using Google. After this is complete, they will be able to select whether to enter vote or battle mode. 

	- In vote mode, users will be shown two photos. They can then click on the photo that they prefer which will give that photo their vote and display the percentage of votes that each photo has received and then will display the next two photos to vote on. 

	- In battle mode, users will be allowed to submit two photos of their own that will be added to the database of photos and displayed to other users to voted on as well.

	- Future development, adding a profile that will show users all the pairs of photos they have submitted for battle and the votes that each have received by the public.
